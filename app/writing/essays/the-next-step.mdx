> "The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways… In the future, the great division will be between those who have trained themselves to handle these complexities and those who are overwhelmed by them-those who can acquire skills and discipline their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted by all the media around them and can never focus enough to learn."<br /><br />

As I look for my next job — one I hope to be long-term and of great depth — it's hard to not worry about the future.<br /><br />

With AI being constantly in the conversation, and with CEOs making dramatic decisions that impact employees, it's hard to not ask:<br /><br />

_"Am I committing to a career path that may soon be redundant?"_<br /><br />

This can induce "analysis paralysis," which can be painfully frustrating yet difficult to escape. We are only human after all.<br /><br />

If you ask certain people, AI has already achieved a level of sophistication that humans can't compete with. For example, I built this entire website and nextpromo.io using AI, barely writing a single line of code.<br /><br />

Yet for others, human judgment is still required. I'm yet to see AI write with as much empthy and humour as even moderately skilled human writers. Even beurocratic instiutions rely on human judgment to solve problems, such as how to combat new AI-powered scams.

I'm probably naive, but I think we will adapt at a speed that matches AI adoption. Because tech may move quickly, but social and cultural phenomena, like jobs, don't all change overnight.<br /><br />

> "Social change is slower than technological change. We should not expect to see immediate global effects of AI in a major way, no matter how fast its adoption (and it is remarkably fast), yet we certainly will see it sooner than many people think."<br /><br />

At the end of the day, if I only get a few years out of a job that I love before it's made obsolete, it won't be for nothing. I will have acquired skills, experience, and connections that may prove lucrative in the future.<br /><br />

It may not be smooth sailing, but it certainly won't be the end of the world. (All the more reason to save money and invest in education).<br /><br />

Most importantly, I will have developed domain-specific judgment, which I think will be a huge asset in this coming age.<br /><br />
